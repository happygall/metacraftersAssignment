# brisCoin Token Contract

brisCoin is a basic ERC-20-like token contract written in Solidity. 

This contract allows users to create and manage tokens, including minting and burning functionalities. 

It can serve as a starting point for building your own token on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

Minting: Create new tokens and assign them to specific addresses.

Burning: Destroy tokens by deducting them from the total supply and an address's balance.

Balance Tracking: Keep track of token balances for each address.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites

Ethereum-Compatible Development Environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat)

Solidity Compiler (0.8.18)

## Deployment

Open your Ethereum development environment.

Copy and paste the code from the provided brisCoin.sol file into your environment.

Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.

Deploy the contract to your desired Ethereum network.

## Usage

Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using its methods:

mint(address _recipient, uint _amount): Mint new tokens and assign them to the _recipient address.

burn(address _from, uint _amount): Burn tokens by deducting them from the total supply and the _from address's balance.

## Considerations

It's recommended to add event emitters for important contract actions

Access control mechanisms and role-based permissions can enhance security.

Consider using a safe math library to prevent arithmetic overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.
